# RSHomeKit

HomeKit post iOS 9 release has stabilized quite a bit, effectively eliminating slew of bugs and inconsistencies expected from a framework in its first release.

Having worked with HomeKit framework from its nascent beginning, I can empathize with devs working on the framework. It's a rather niche dev community as the framework usage is inherently dependent on a hardware partner - limiting the size of subset.

Sharing this minute utility framework for abstracting some of the most basic functionalities in the HomeKit realm.

I will try and update the framework with more tools intermittently.

Feel free to contribute.
